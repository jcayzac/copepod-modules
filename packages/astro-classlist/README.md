# `@jcayzac/astro-classlist`

This module provides a single utility for [Astro](https://astro.build/) components, that coerce a value received as a [`class:list`](https://docs.astro.build/reference/directives-reference/) prop into an array of strings.

You probably need this if your component receives a `class:list` prop and passes it to a child component, and if you want to add other classes to the list.

Because `class:list` can be an object or an iterable and contain things other than strings, it can get a bit messy if you want to add something to that.

```ts
// This is what you normally get from Astro
type AstroBuiltinAttributes['class:list'] =
  | string
  | Record<string, boolean>
  | Record<any, any>
  | Iterable<string>
  | Iterable<any>
  | undefined

// This is what you get when using this utility
type ClassList = string[]
```
